            <p>In my experience, there is a vast variety of resources for learning programming, you find the resources which look useful and learn the concepts yourself.
            In this section, I will share some resources which I have used till now in order to increase my understanding of computer science.

            <ol> <li><h3>Udemy</h3></li>
                <p>Udemy is a great website that feature courses on majority of computer science concepts.
                    I bought a course on Udemy to learn Java as a complete beginner and it helped me a lot,
                    since I had only studied python during high school and all my university courses were in Java.
                    You also get a certificate after completion of the course, here is mine: </p>

                <br><p>Here is the course which I used: &nbsp;<a id="Java" href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wu43@RnFUlGn2es93W3uToXp_eL7WDYP8P45AE3i94e5171SwNe6dakI6RdHdupbSlhv9RQ==/">Java</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><h3>Youtube</h3></li>
                <p>Youtube is one of the most popular social media website in the world, but it also a great source for 
                    educational contenct. I had learnt the html basics back in middle school and had forgotten them by now so I turned to 
                    youtube to refresh my knowledge. There are a lot of creators with great videos, I followed a channel called Bro Code who 
                    gave the whole guide to html and css concepts in one long video. The video is given below:

                <li><h3>W3Schools</h3></li>
               
                <p>W3Schools is one of the best websites that I have come accross to learn programming, They have information on a multitude of languages and provide a very clear description of the concept and 
                    make the concepts much more easier to understand with appropriate examples, tutorials and exercises. It has basically been the one stop solution for me whenever I forget any concept or want 
                    to learn any new ones. Click on the logo below to open their website.

                <li><h3>Typing Club</h3></li>

                <p>Being able to type fast can be very useful skill when programming, but the reason I wanted to learn touch typing was to type without having to look at my keyboard constantly. Typing club is 
                    a great free online resource which helped me greatly increase my touch typing speed in only a few months, I can now write upto almost 70 WPM (Words Per Minute).
