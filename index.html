                   I am a highly motivated and driven first year student, I'm eager to gain knowledge and very motivated to improve my grasp on programming concepts, I like to put my problem solving skills to use and try to figure out new ways to counter any problem.
                </p>
               
                <h4>My Educational Accredtitions: </h4>

                <p id="projects"> I made some python projects in high school with the rudimentary undersatnding of programming concepts, but most of the projects which depict
                        my skills and understanding are written in Java during my time at Dalhousie. I have made use of important programming concepts such as Object 
                        Oriented Programming, Aggregation, Inhertance and used algorithms to develop interactive projects, the complete documentation of my projects 
                        can be found here: &nbsp; <a href="Projects.html">My Projects</a>
