                <li>Farm managment - This project uses concepts such as inheritance, aggregation and object oriented programming to 
                    manage a farmer's farms and all the food grown on it. It allows the farmer to grow on the farm and alter the conditions
                     such as the type of soil and growing period according to each food's requirements. The farmer also keeps track of the the 
                     cost of each food after it is harvested and can calculate the total farm value.

                    RPN Calculator - A RPN Calculator takes input in the form of a string and evaluates it as postfix notation and returns the final
                     result. The project features three classes which are used to convert the string into postfix notation, solve the string in RPN 
                     form and return the result, and a class which implements both of the methods.

                    Battleship game - A simpler version of the battleship game made using java. The user can set the size of the game board which is
                     made using a 2D array, both users place their boats on the game board by specifying how much space they want their boat to take
                      and the coordinates where the boat is to be placed, and the boat size is automatically adjusted if it is going out of bounds. 
                      The players enter the number of shots they want to fire and the then enter the coordinated of the target, all hits are represented
                       by 'X' and the boats are represented by 'B'. At the end of the game a winner is declared by comparing the game statistics. Here is 
                       an example of what the game board would look like:
                </li><br>
                <table>
                    <tr>

                        <td>-</td>
                        <td>X</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>B</td>

                        <td>-</td>

                        <td>-</td>
                        <td>B</td>
                        <td>X</td>
                        <td>-</td>

                        <td>X</td>
                        <td>-</td>

                    Frogger game - This project uses java to create a simple version of the frogger game. Allows user to control the behavior of a frog 
                    using arrow keys to try to cross the street while avoiding the cars. Contains classes which control the movements of the frog and the 
                    cars, and also the game logic, which determines when the frog has been hit. Here is a video of frogger gameplay for reference:

                    Battleship bomber - he game logic is similar to the regular battleship but instead of firing shots, the players fire bombs which have
                     a blast radius in the shape of a rhombus. All targets within the blast radius are destroyed and any hits out of bounds
                      are automatically discarded.
